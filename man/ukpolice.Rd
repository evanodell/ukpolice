\title{ukpolice: Download Data on UK Police and Crime}
\description{
Downloads data from the 'UK Police' public data API. Includes data on UK
police forces and police force areas, crime reports, and the use of
stop-and-search powers.
}
\details{
Most functions return a \code{tibble} with the requested data, with the exception
of \code{\link[=ukc_specific_outcome]{ukc_specific_outcome()}} in some cases, which returns a list containing a
list and a \code{tibble}.

Data accessed through \code{ukpolice} is licenced with
\href{https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/}{Open Government Licence v3.0}.

The API allows for 15 requests each second, but up to 30 in a single second
if in a single burst. The API does not require authentication.
See the \href{https://data.police.uk/docs/}{API documentation} for more details.
