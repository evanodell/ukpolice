<p>The <code>ukpolice</code> package downloads data from the UK Police public data API, the full docs of which are available at <a href="https://data.police.uk/docs/" class="uri">https://data.police.uk/docs/</a>.</p>
<p>The API uses a ‘leaky bucket’ rate limiter, which allows for 15 requests per second with a burst of 30. This allows for 15 requests each second, but up to 30 in a single second at one go. The API does not require authentication.</p>
<p>Data is available on police forces, crimes, policing areas and stop-and-search. All functions begin with <code>ukc_</code>.</p>
<p>The example below queries stop and searches by the Metropolitan Police in December 2018, and plots them by police-reported ethnic group.</p>
