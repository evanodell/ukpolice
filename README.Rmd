# ukpolice

The `ukpolice` package downloads data from the UK Police public data API, the full docs of which are available at https://data.police.uk/docs/.

It can be installed from CRAN with:

```
install.packages("ukpolice")
```

Data is available on police forces, crimes, policing areas and stop-and-search.

The example below queries stop and searches by the Thames Valley Police in December 2018, and plots them by police-reported ethnic group.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ukpolice)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

tv_ss <- ukc_stop_search_force("thames-valley", date = "2018-12")

tv_ss2 <- tv_ss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(officer_defined_ethnicity) & outcome != "" ) %>%
  group_by(officer_defined_ethnicity, outcome) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/sum(n))

p1 <- ggplot(tv_ss2, aes(x = outcome, y = perc,
                             group = outcome, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent,
                     breaks = seq(0.25, 0.8, by = 0.25)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::wrap_format(15)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) + 
  labs(x = "Outcome", 
       y = "Percentage of stop and searches resulting in outcome",
       title = "Stop and Search Outcomes by Police-Reported Ethnicity",
       subtitle = "Thames Valley Police Department, December 2018",
       caption = "(c) Evan Odell | 2019 | CC-BY-SA") + 
  facet_wrap(~officer_defined_ethnicity)
